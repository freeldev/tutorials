// redux is flux-like but not exactly flux
// redux contains :
//          actions
//          action creators
//          store
//          action objects
//          reducers        pure functions which return a new state based on the current state and an action: (state, action) => newState

// redux removes the dispatcher from flux and represents
// state with a single immutable object

// ACTIONS ARE THE ONLY WAY TO UPDATE THE STATE IN REDUX
// actions provide us with instructions about what should change
// they are also receipts about the history of what has changed`
