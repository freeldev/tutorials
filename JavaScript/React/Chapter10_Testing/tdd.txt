letting testing drive your development proccess is TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT

3 steps 

1.) Write the tests first

    this is the most critical step.  You declare what you are building and how
    it should work first in a test.

2.) Run the tests and watch them fail (red)

    run your tests and whatch them fail before you write the code

3.) Write the minimal amount of code rqeuired to make the tests pass ( green )

    now all you have to do is make the tests pass.  focus on specifically 
    making each tests pass: do not add any functinoality beyond the scope
    of this test


4.) Refactor both the code and the tests (gold)

    Once the tests pass, it is time to take a closer lookat your code and your tests.
    try to express your code as simply and as beautifully as possible.
