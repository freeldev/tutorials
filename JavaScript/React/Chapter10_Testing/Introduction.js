// unit testing allows us to test every unit of our application

// functional code is very testable -- functions are naturally testable

// ESLint - sincee JS does not come with a compiler we use this to analyze our code
// to find mistakes

// we will work with eslint-plugin-react (already instaleld in create react app)
